### System Performance Monitor in C for Windows
### Description

This System Performance Monitoring program is developed in C for Windows systems. It offers real-time monitoring of various system performance metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network traffic. Our goal is to provide a lightweight, yet powerful tool for system administrators and users who wish to monitor and analyze their system's performance.
